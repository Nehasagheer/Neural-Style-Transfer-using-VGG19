# Neural-Style-Transfer-using-VGG19
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique that takes two images—one as the content image and another as the style image—and blends them to create a new image that retains the content structure of the first image and the artistic style of the second.

We use a pre-trained VGG19 model to extract feature maps from specific layers, which capture both the content and the style of the images. By optimizing a generated image, we create a new image that reflects the content of one and the style of the other.
